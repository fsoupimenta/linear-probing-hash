# Linear Probing Hash 🔑🗄️
Linear probing hash is a software to visualize the creation and manipulation of a hash table with linear-probing collision treatment for a better understanding.

## Linear Probing Collision Treatment 🔍🎯

Collision handling in a hash table using linear probing is a technique used to deal with situations where two or more calculated hash keys result in the same table index, i.e. a collision occurs.

A hash table is a data structure that allows the storage and fast retrieval of elements associated with unique keys. It uses a hash function to convert the keys into table indexes where the elements are stored. However, when two different keys produce the same index, a collision occurs.

Linear probing is one of the common approaches to resolve collisions in a hash table. In this technique, when a collision occurs, the element with the duplicate hash key is simply placed in the next available position in the table. The idea is to do a sequential search through subsequent indexes until an empty position is found where the element can be stored.

For example, suppose the hash function produced the same index for two different keys:

 1. Key A -> Hash (index) = 5
 2. Key B -> Hash (index) = 5 (collision)

If there is a collision, the hash table is updated as follows using linear probing:

 1. Index 5: Key A (first key calculated).
 2. Index 6: Key B (second calculated key, placed at the next available index after 5)

It is worth noting that when searching for an available position, it is necessary to take into account that the hash table can be circular, i.e. the search can continue from the beginning of the table if it has reached the end.

## Tecnologies 🔧
- [Python](https://www.python.org)
- [PyQt6](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt6/)

## Usage 💻
To use the program, simply install and run the `main.exe` file generated in the latest release.

When the program starts, it will open the screen below in which the user must enter the size of the hash table, this size being a prime number greater than 2. If the user does not enter anything, the software will use the size 23 by default:

After that, the main screen below will appear showing the table and the operations that can be performed.
